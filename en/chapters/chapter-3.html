                It seems that a ferry has existed at Barmouth as long as the town has; if not
                longer. The ferry was historically run by monks, possibly from Cymer Abbey at
                Llanelltyd. Monks also resided in Barmouth at Plas Mynach.

                Barmouth is a natural harbour sheltered by surrounding mountains. There was a
                good approach from the channel that exists today and a channel that ran
                between the island, Ynys y Brawd, and the harbour (where the causeway is now)
                with navigable waterways all the way to Llanelltyd. In those days the harbour was
                probably somewhere along Church Street with the water running along Water
                Street.

                The Port Books of Milford record the first vessel bound for Barmouth as the Mary
                (Maru) of Fishguard in 1566, soon followed by the Michael of Milford. Early cargoes
                included grain, pilcorn, wheat, barley, oats and rye. Commodities which were not
                available locally.

                In 1587 there is a record of Le Angell de Bermo, an 18 ton vessel belonging to
                Barmouth.

                There is a record in the Caernarvonshire Port Books 1630-90 that in 1676 the
                Godspeed of Barmouth entered Pwllheli with a cargo of 6 tons of oak poles.
                In the late 1700's / early 1800s there were three shipbuilding yards in Barmouth
                with many more lining the Mawddach. 318 vessels were built between 1779 and
                1790, that's between 6 or 7 a year - and some of which were big square riggers
                weighing up to 200 tons.

                By 1779 the town was flourishing and an increase in shipping saw an Act of
                Parliament passed. This act enabled the “repairing, deepening, enlarging and
                preserving the Harbour of Barmouth in the County of Merioneth”. Barmouth
                Harbour Trust was created to put the act into effect. At this time the harbour was
                at Aberamffra, near the Clock House as you come in to Barmouth. The trustees
                erected a small stone embankment at a cost of £1,660 which helped increase the
                depth in the harbour. Five years later a new quay was constructed. The main
                reason for this improvement was the Wool Trade. Money for the harbour
                improvements was raised by loans with the borrowing power restricted to £9,000.
                From this point the principle port of Merioneth was improved as the trustees and
                officials developed the harbour as they saw fit. More improvements were made in
                the late 1800s.

                Barmouth became the most important port in the area and web or flannels were
                exported from here as well as stockings. Imports would include wood, wine, iron,
                corn, brandy, rum, tea, coal, tobacco, tallow, gunpowder, malt, butter, skins, ore,
                flour and lead as well as other items. There were many wealthy merchants in the
                town and schooners, brigantines and steamers came and went. Destinations
                included the Americas, France, Spain and Ireland. The wool trade was decimated
                by the War of Independence in America which had a detrimental effect on the
                shipping industry in Barmouth for a while, but the advent of the North Wales slate
                export trade took off in the early 1800s which saw an end to this period. Wool was
                still exported along with oak bark, timber, cheese and butter. Small sailing vessels
                would head up the Mawddach to fetch goods from landing places along the river.
                Square Riggers were a common sight at Barmouth before being replaced by
                Schooners.

                With increased shipping came dangers out to sea and a few attempts were
                made to build a lighthouse at Barmouth to warn of the rocks. Each attempt failed
                with the structures being knocked down. The foundation of one is still here today
                at the Perch which can be seen just off Ynys y Brawd.

                People of Barmouth have been volunteering to save lives at sea since 1828, when
                Barmouth received its first lifeboat. To date there have been 10 lifeboats at
                Barmouth, starting out with oars before progressing to motor and now jets. The
                first two boats under oar were unnamed. The first named boat was the Ellen in
                1868. The Ellen was followed by the first of two boats called the Jones-Gibb I and II,
                named after their donor Mrs Jones Gibb of Tunbridge Wells. Oars then gave way
                to motor with the arrival of the Lawrence Ardern Stockport. Next was the iconic
                Chieftain which served the town from 1948 to 1982 and the last boat to be slipway
                launched. The Princess of Wales came to Barmouth next, but too big for the
                boathouse, she sat on a mooring just off the Barmouth Bridge. The next occupant
                of the mooring was the Moira Barrie who came into service in 1992 before being
                replaced in 2019 by today's lifeboat The Ella Larsen. We can't mention the lifeboats
                without referring to the D-Class Inshore Lifeboat which Barmouth first received in
                1967. This was ideal for rescues in shallow waters, cliff edges and the estuary. Fast
                and manoeuvrable it became the workhorse of the fleet. The first D-Class in
                Barmouth was D-137. The home of the lifeboat has changed through the years in
                Barmouth. The first lifeboat house was on the quay. The location is believed to be
                the shed next to Davy Jones Locker, to the right as you face it. In 1859 the
                boathouse then moved to near the start of Barmouth Bridge, built into the rock
                with its own slip. By 2004 the lifeboat was becoming tidally restricted as to when it
                could launch so a new boathouse was built on the Promenade with a tractor
                launch and recovery system, from the beach, to ensure 24/7 cover in the bay.

                In 1834 the Round House was built. It was built after a meeting between prominent
                residents and freeholders as a result of frequent drunken riots, usually late at
                night, also the constables had nowhere to place the offenders until they were
                brought before the magistrates. An application was made to the Magistrates to
                pay for the lock up from county rates and another application that more special
                constables were appointed. The seafarers in the town would often drink heavily after long periods at
                sea. It wasn't just the sailors as there were a number of
                women who habitually caused disturbances as well. The building was erected in a
                circular shape with a dividing wall down the middle, one side for the men and the
                other for the women. The building is said to be round so there are no corners for
                the devil to hide in!

                By 1867 the railway arrived in Barmouth and this saw a rapid decline in shipping.
                The town experienced hard times for about ten years. As sail gave way to steam
                one of Barmouth's most famous vessels came in to play, The SS Dora. The Dora
                was a 296 Gross Ton Coastal Steamer who plied her trade mainly between
                Liverpool, Barmouth and Aberdovey in the early 1900s. Owned by the Aberdovey
                and Barmouth Steamship Company she was sunk on 1 May 1917 when returning
                from Belfast to Liverpool. She was stopped by a German U-Boat under the
                command of Otto Steinbrink who ordered the crew into lifeboats before placing
                explosives on the Dora and scuttling her. The large building / shed on the quay,
                that the toilet blocks are attached to, is still known as the Dora Building to this day.

                As tourism grew in the mid 20th Century motor boat trips became popular and
                local boatmen would advertise on boards on the sheds by the quay. There were a
                dozen or so small boats, licensed to carry twelve, including the Skylark, the
                Enterprise, the Sally, the Pansy and the May Queen. Three larger boats, licensed to
                carry 36 passengers, also provided boat trips they were the Prince of Wales, the
                Princess Royal and the Welsh Girl. As well as the ferry to Fairbourne the trips would
                go up the estuary to Penmaenpool, trips out into Cardigan Bay and trips to
                Mochras / Shell Island. Trips to Penmaenpool were a favourite with an 8 mile
                passage up the glorious Mawddach. The journey gave the most spectacular
                scenery but required considerable seamanship and navigational skills. The
                channel was always changing and knowledge of the location of the sandbanks
                was required.

                At 10:55 on 22nd July 1966, Ned Jones aged 73, a man with over 50 years of
                experience on the Mawddach set off for Penmaenpool in command of the Prince
                of Wales. There were 42 passengers onboard, 6 more than it was licensed for; 15
                were children between the ages of 3 and 12 years. The vessel grounded twice on
                sandbanks on its voyage up the estuary. The Prince of Wales arrived at
                Penmaenpool at 1145 with the flood tide running at full force between 4 and 5
                knots. The vessel passed the jetty with the intention of turning to port to stem the
                tide for the approach to the jetty. It appears Mr Jones made the turn too late and
                was not turning as quickly as expected despite the tiller being hard over. In order
                to give the boat more speed he let go of the tiller to increase the speed of the
                engine. The boat was unable to complete the turn and the flood tide carried her
                to the bridge where she collided with one of the lower stretchers. These are solid
                beams that protrude from the upright members and are only visible at low water.
                This severely damaged the boat and left a large hole causing the boat to rapidly
                sink. Two lifebelts floated free and some passengers managed to reach these but
                the other lifebelts were tied to the boat and there was no time to release them.
                Despite the valiant efforts of Mr John Hall of the George III Hotel and his staff, 15
                lives were lost. The tragedy affected the whole town and as a result all boat trips
                were stopped at the time.

                In the 1950s there was one lobster fishing boat on the quay, the MV Thomas
                Sinclair. Then during the 1960s more lobster boats came to Barmouth from
                Pembrokeshire and Cardigan. Lobster fishermen were a hardy bunch and would
                fish here for about 9 months of the year. Then in 1973, Iolo Hughes, a maths
                teacher turned lobster fisherman from New Quay, began landing bags of queen
                scallops from his boat Seren Y Don. He had found a bed about 15 miles off
                Barmouth and would sneak out in the middle of the night. At first no one knew
                where he was fishing but soon the other fishermen found out and either
                converted or bought boats suitable for dredging. The boats could be out for over
                36 hours at a time but it was very lucrative.

                Before long boats came from Cornwall, France, Holland and Ireland; sometimes
                they would lie 6 or 7 abreast on the quayside. An ice plant was installed and huge
                refrigerated lorries belonging to the French firm Jarno were a regular sight on the
                quay. The trucks would groan out of town under the weight of the scallops. As the
                scallops became scarcer the fishing trade dropped off, there was still some
                fishing through the 80s but eventually the numbers dropped to a small amount of
                vessels. Eventually leisure craft became the main type of boating in the harbour
                with a few charter fishing boats offering Mackerel Fishing for the tourists and of
                course the Fairbourne Ferry.

                Inspired by the adventures of Major Bill Tilman, the Three Peaks Yacht Race was
                started in 1977. Dr Rob Haworth, a local GP who knew Major Tilman, was going on

                climbing Snowdon, then sailing to Ravenglass and climbing Scaffell Pike, then
                onwards to Fort William and climbing Ben Nevis. While explaining his idea to his
                medical partner, Dr Merfyn Jones, Dr Jones suggested it would make a marvellous
                race and so the event was born. The race is held annually and at its height
                attracted between 35 and 40 boats.

                point of the town and has always remained a beautiful place to visit.
