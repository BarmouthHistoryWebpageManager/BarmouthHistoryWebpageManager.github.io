                Cairns, burial sites and Cerrig y Cledd (The Sword Stones) in the hills surrounding
                Barmouth suggest that the area was important during the Bronze Age. There is
                also much archaeological evidence from the Iron Age showing fortifications and
                structures in the area

                A 5th century inscribed stone was found on Ceilwart Isaf farm in Llanaber and
                another on the beach at Barmouth. The first stone was inscribed with "Caelexti
                Monedo Rigi" which can be interpreted as "Caelestis, Mountain King", which
                suggests an early administrative unit in the area covering both the coast and the
                mountains or it could possibly refer to Caelestis Monedorix a mythical king of
                Mona (Anglesey). The second stone is inscribed with "Aeterni Et Aeternai",
                possibly brother and sister. The first name could refer to Edernus, an early saint
                and son of Cunedda Wledig, king of the north Britons in the 5th century. Edernus
                lived around 520-580CE. The stones can be seen in St Marys and St Bodfan's
                church in Llanaber

                There is a recording of the river Mawddach in 1188 by Gerald Cambrensis (Gerald
                of Wales, the Archbishop of Brecon). During Henry II reign the Archbishop Baldwyn
                of Canterbury was sent to Wales to muster support for a further crusade to
                liberate Jerusalem. The Archbishop chose Gerald as his chaplain and they set out on their expedition
                across Wales supported by a troop of some 3000 armed men.
                Gerald travelled across the Dyfi to Tywyn, then over the Mawddach, probably at
                Llanelltyd where there was a ford and a ferry run by monks, before carrying on to
                Llanfair. There are some interpretations that assert that Gerald crossed the
                Mawddach by ferry from Penrhyn Point to Ynys y Brawd and then by a second
                ferry from Ynys y Brawd to the mainland where Barmouth now stands.

                <blockquote>
                    We slept that night at Tywyn. Early next morning, Gruffydd son of
                    Conan came to meet us, humbly and devoutly asking pardon for having so
                    long delayed his attention to the archbishop. On the same day, we ferried
                    over the bifurcate river Maw, where Malgo, son of Rhys, who had attached
                    himself to the archbishop, as a companion to the king's court, discovered a
                    ford near the sea.

                    That night we lay at Llanfair, that is the church of St. Mary, in the
                    province of Ardudwy. This territory of Conan, and particularly Merionyth,
                    is the rudest and roughest district of all Wales; the ridges of its mountains
                    are very high and narrow, terminating in sharp peaks, and so irregularly
                    jumbled together, that if the shepherds conversing or disputing with each
                    other from their summits, should agree to meet, they could scarcely effect
                    their purpose in the course of the whole day. The lances of this country are
                    very long; for as South Wales excels in the use of the bow, so North Wales
                    is distinguished for its skill in the lance; insomuch that an iron coat of mail
                    will not resist the stroke of a lance thrown at a small distance.

                According to legend, the palace of King Gwyddno, ruler of the legendary Cantre
                Gwaelod, the Welsh Atlantis, was at Garandir on the sea-facing hillslope at, or
                near, Barmouth. A large enclosure half-way between Llanaber church and
                Barmouth appears on Lewis Morris's 1748 map of the coastline which does not
                exist in any form today.

                At some period, a fortification, now known as Castell, existed above Barmouth
                guarding a route between the church in Llanaber and a creek at the mouth of the
                Dwynant river. This creek would later be a "free landing place of the people".
                The Merioneth Lay Subsidy Roll of 1292-1293 recorded Llanaber as being relatively
                well off, worth between 30 and 40 shillings per 1000 acres. They also record
                Llanaber as having 101 tax payers in the Parish at that time.
                In 1294 a grant to a Bleddyn Fychan refers to lands in Maenol Llanaber with a
                small villa called Caer Hepnewid, perhaps lands near the Llanaber Church with
                Castell above.

                There was a church at the site of St Mary's and Bodfan in the 6th Century built by St

                May with its animals to the mountains."

                Gruffydd ap Llewelyn ap Cynwrig "to have masses celebrated in the oratory of the
                poor hospital of St Mary the Virgin in the said diocese situate between two arms of

                The island Ynys y Brawd was an actual island before the causeway was built. The
                channel used to run between the island and Barmouth Beach as well as the
                existing channel that passes between the point and Penrhyn Point. Earlier than
                that, it used to run as the North Channel, as far as St. Mary's in Llanaber. Long ago
                the harbour was probably somewhere along Church Street and it is believed that there are still mooring
                rings in the cellar of the Fanny Talbot (previously the Lion
                Hotel). It is possible that wrecks of old boats still lie under the main street. There
                was a time that the Georgian cottages of Water Street were the nearest to the
                water hence their name. It is also understood that there was a mooring area
                where the football field and The Wern now stand which afforded a safe mooring
                from North Easterlies.
