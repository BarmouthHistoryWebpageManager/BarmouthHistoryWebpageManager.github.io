                Although it is south Wales that is famous for mining, there were a lot of mines in
                this area. At one point there were 24 mines operating although not all were
                successful. It is believed that gold was discovered in Merioneth in 1834 but mining
                didn't start until 1847, as the idea that there was gold in the area was ridiculed at
                first. A gold belt runs from Barmouth to the north of Bontddu. The two most
                famous mines are Clogau, which is above Bontddu, and Gwynfynydd which is
                above the head of the Mawddach estuary.

                Clogau mine is also known as S. David's mine or Clogau St David's. In 1860 a vein
                of gold was struck and in just over three years the mine had produced £43,783
                worth of gold. As word got out a Klondike type Gold Rush occurred with many new
                companies forming and people arriving to mine. Expensive machines were
                purchased and buildings built before the prospecting was complete. Not all the
                ventures were successful. The area bustled with life and work. Many farmers in the
                area would trek from their farms to work in the dangerous conditions of the mines.
                The workers would mostly stay in barracks at the mine in the week and head
                home for the weekends. The barracks sheltered hundreds. Barmouth did not
                benefit from the trade that these workers brought as much as Dolgellau as most
                of the workers' wages were spent there.

                Four Barmouth businessmen created the Clogau Gold Mining Company in 1891
                and in the following 5 years £19,688 worth of gold was mined. By 1899 a new
                company was formed called Saint Davids Gold and Copper Mines who purchased
                the Clogau mine as well as others in the area. At its height there were around 100
                miners employed in the Bontddu district. The company was successful at first but
                unfortunately the gold became scarcer and by 1910 the Clogau mine was closed.

                The Gwynfynydd mine was originally a lead mine, gold was first discovered there
                in 1864. Between 1888 and 1890 £35,000 of gold was extracted and then after that
                very little was found. The mine shut in 1916 when most of the miners were called
                up for the First World War.

                In 1930 an enquiry opened in Dolgellau to look into the possibility of restarting the
                mining in the area. The aim was to reduce unemployment; previous data of
                ounces was produced and the employment of 500 men was used. However it was
                felt that even though there were unexplored gold veins, their number and size
                were uncertain and the cost of exploring them could outweigh any return. A few
                attempts have been made to mine over the years since then but with no lasting
                result. In the 1950's a local farmer tried to re-open a Bontddu mine but this
                venture did not last long.

                The Clogau mine is the namesake of the Clogau Gold Jewellery brand which is
                world famous. Welsh Gold has been used in Royal rings and regalia for over 100
                years. It is the most sought after gold as it is the rarest. Many Royals have had
                their wedding rings made from Clogau gold. They are:

                As well as the gold mines manganese and copper were also mined in the area. In
                1862 a firm named Barmouth Consols Copper, Silver-Lead & Gold Mining Co. Ltd
                was registered in London. It was trying to purchase a patch of land in Llangelynin
                but by 1878 the company was said to be “no longer carrying on in business.” A rich belt of manganese
                ran between Barmouth and Harlech in what is known as the Harlech Dome, which saw a chain of different
                mines running along the belt. There
                were many mines found directly around Barmouth.

                Barmouth mine is located behind the house called Deronda, just above St John's
                Church. It runs along the lower part of the path towards Craig y Gigfran (The
                Peak). Its entrance can be seen and was the playground of many a Barmouth
                child. Barmouth mine consisted of a number of underground workings. A letter
                exists from the owner in Birmingham, a John Abraham, complaining of falling
                output to which the foreman replied that there was an epidemic of influenza in
                Barmouth. The mine existed from 1886 to 1891 and produced 1,261 tons in that time,
                on average employing 2 men. 1889 produced 545 tons alone. There are several
                entrances; two are on the path to the peak, one is next to the entrance to St John's
                Churchyard and one is a dripping well located along the path behind Deronda.
                They follow a quartz seam.

                Dinas Oleu (The National Trust land given by Fanny Talbot) is listed as a
                manganese mine. It is above the Barmouth formation which is above the Hafotty
                formation which contains a manganese ore bed. However it appears more like a
                stone quarry which can be seen over the road from the car park next to the Last
                Inn and up towards the Slabs above Panorama road.

                Cell Fawr Mine (the farm behind the peak) is connected to the Hafotty mine and
                the Cell Fechan mine (the ruined farm on the path to the peak) all of which run
                along the Barmouth to Harlech Manganese Belt. Between 1891 and 1892 Cell Fawr produced 954 tons and
                employed 8 people. A tramway existed between Cell Fawr and the Hafotty mine. The Cell Fechan mine
                existed from about 1899 and
                produced 867 tons between that year and 1908. Its largest return was in 1900
                when 277 tons were extracted. There is a network of tracks cut into the slopes
                around the area which probably served the workings. Hafotty is located above
                Llanaber in-between the Cell Fawr and Egryn mines. The mine contains iron
                pyrites, manganese and quartz. The mine produced 12,204 tons between 1886 and
                1900 and in 1887 employed 52 people. 1890 was its best year producing 3,946 tons
                and employing 34 people. Within the mine there was a tramway, which took the
                mineral to a loading point where a railway moved it to another loading point.
                From this point a horse-drawn sledge took the ore to Barmouth Road near St
                Marys where a horse and cart would transport it to Barmouth Station; usually
                three loads a day.

                Garn (alternatively Panorama) mine is located at the Panorama walk and has a
                distinctive, obvious mine entrance. It is unclear what was mined here but it is
                described as the Panorama Copper and Gold mine and the entrance is built into
                the wall. The mine shaft is flooded.

                As can be easily seen, the hills around Barmouth are rocky and high with some
                grass land and some woodland. The area is not suitable for arable farming and
                the majority of farming in the area is pasture fields for livestock such as sheep,
                cattle and some horses. Comparing the fieldscapes of today against those over
                150 years ago on maps, they have not changed much. It is easy to see the dry
                stone walls that appear all over the area and work their way down the slopes
                around the town and its outer limits. These walls are also well over 150 years old
                and mark the boundaries of the fields. Much of the landscape in the area is steep
                sloped woodland interspersed with pasture fields. The wood ranges in age from
                ancient to semi natural to mostly modern.

                Most of the enclosures in the area are large and irregular in shape. Although no
                arable fields exist today there is evidence of what looks like post medieval land
                divisions probably for arable land cultivation, as it seems the fields had been
                cleared carefully of stones in what is a very rocky area. Upland areas were left as
                they are with no evidence of clearing taking place.

                Actually Merioneth has always had one of the lowest proportions of arable land in
                Wales and England. Life would have been very hard farming the hills around here;
                living on the high slopes and enduring the harsh terrain. Imagine the times when
                there was no electricity or fuel or running water or supermarkets, living on these
                farms high above the towns, on the slopes and in the valleys. Imagine a harsh
                winter! The only entertainment would be the chapel; for many this would be
                Cutiau. Many of the farms were tenant farms, that is where a landlord owned the
                land and a farmer would farm the land. Squires of the 1800's were known for
                gambling to entertain themselves. It was not unusual for a tenant farmer to wake
                up in the morning and find they had a new landlord. There was a case where the
                eldest son of one family inherited a large farm estate with a house, livestock, land
                and fishing rights. Within a short space of time of inheriting it, he lost the lot in one
                night of gambling and had to move his family into his brother's nearby farm.

                Cattle and livestock would be either driven into town to be auctioned off outside
                the Cors y Gedol building or in Dolgellau. In fact it was not unusual to see sheep
                and cows wandering the streets of Barmouth up to the 1980s although this was
                usually a few escapees. The well-known big landlords of the area in the past
                were Cors y Gedol, Nannau and Lord Harlech.

                The wool trade was the biggest thing spanning the later parts of the 1600s, the
                1700s and the 1800s. In 1770 Barmouth port exported £50,000 worth of wool
                products all around the world. The sheep would be sheared at the farms and then
                the wool taken to mills where it would be made into cloths on looms. There were
                very few factories in Wales before 1800 and almost all production was at home
                but as trans-Atlantic demand for Welsh cloth grew Merionethshire became
                dependant on the wool trade. Spinning and weaving gave a more stable and
                larger income than farming did. Some farms would have a fulling mill connected
                to it to full (thicken) the cloth. These mills were usually water-driven but there are
                examples of horizontal mills in the area that were horse-driven and used for
                grinding.

                Up above Glandwr Mill, where the Dwynant river flows down the valley, lies a
                holiday home. This was once a farm called Tyddyn y Pandy (Tyddyn -
                Homestead/Small Holding, Pandy - Fulling Mill). The same family farmed here for
                at least 160 years. Robert Williams kept a farm account book from 1843 to 1846.
                The book is a fascinating insight into how a farm operated in those times and
                shows transactions between Robert Williams and other local farms buying and
                selling cattle and timber as well as selling pigs and also butter to inhabitants of
                the town. One page shows the farmer paying wages to his workers including his
                miller David Jones. There are even drawings of the farm by his child, of the same
                name, who went on to be a sea captain. Interestingly there is an entry in 1845 for
                paying the doctor (pre-NHS times) and then a coffin. This was for his first wife
                passing away, then later that year paying for the ring for his second marriage.
                There are many entries of him still doing business with his first father-in-law,
                Edward Williams of Cell Fawr. Roberts's son, Cadwaladr, and then his children
                would take over the farm eventually, though only one of them remained a farmer
                throughout his life.

                To illustrate the control of the estates in the area, a brochure from 1911 shows the
                sale of valuable farms, small holdings, accommodation and building lands and
                freehold ground rents with reservations. The sale was by the direction of Lord
                Harlech and took place at Cors y Gedol Hotel, Barmouth. Many local farms were
                included. The following freehold and ground rents with reservations were offered:

                As has been seen previously farms such as Cell Fawr and Cell Fechan had mines
                on their land. It's said that Cell Fawr has a horse drawn horizontal grinding mill
                wheel. There is also a road that goes north from the farm and under this road
                there are holes. These holes used to be a larder for winter storage of food.

                Farms have seemed to diversify to survive over the years with camping, caravan
                sites, hydro schemes, building and local produce to name but a few.
